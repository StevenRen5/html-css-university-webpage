# Responsive University Website

This project is a fully responsive multi-page university website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**. It was created by following the [Easy Tutorials YouTube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA&t=2721s), and served as my second web development project to strengthen my frontend skills.

## Features

- Fully responsive design across all screen sizes
- Five linked pages through a top navigation bar:
  - Home
  - About
  - Courses
  - Facilities
  - Testimonials
- JavaScript used for interactive navigation toggle (`onclick`)
- Mobile menu using the hamburger icon (sidebar navigation)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I:
- Learned to build a complete responsive layout from scratch
- Practiced multi-page navigation structure
- Improved my understanding of using percent-based values (e.g., width: _%, flex-basis: _% to build responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes 
- Gained basic experience in adding interactivity with JavaScript
